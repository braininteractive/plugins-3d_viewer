# FileRun Plugin: 3D Viewer
FileRun plugin for viewing 3D files. Currently supported file types: OBJ/MTL, STL, FBX, DAE.
# Installation
- Copy the "3d_viewer" folder inside your FileRun installation folder's "customizables/plugins" folder.
- You might need to clear your browser's cache to see the new "Open with.." option.
- Tip: you can associate the above file extensions with the plugin, from FileRun's control panel, under "Files" -> "Plugins" -> "Defaults", so that you can simply double-click your 3D files, rather than using the right-click menu.
